### Facebook Pixel Implementation Guide

#### Setup for Next.js 14 App Router
1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install react-facebook-pixel
```

2. **Create Pixel Component:**
```typescript
// components/FacebookPixel.tsx
'use client';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import ReactPixel from 'react-facebook-pixel';

interface FacebookPixelProps {
  pixelId: string;
}

const FacebookPixel = ({ pixelId }: FacebookPixelProps) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    ReactPixel.init(pixelId);
    ReactPixel.pageView();
  }, [pixelId]);

  return null;
};

export default FacebookPixel;
```

3. **Add to Layout:**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import FacebookPixel from '@/components/FacebookPixel';
import Script from 'next/script';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Script
          id="facebook-pixel"
          strategy="afterInteractive"
        >
          {`
            !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
            {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
            n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
            if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
            n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
            t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
            s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
            'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
            fbq('init', '${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID}');
            fbq('track', 'PageView');
          `}
        </Script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <FacebookPixel pixelId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID!} />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

4. **Event Tracking Hook:**
```typescript
// hooks/useFacebookPixel.ts
import { useCallback } from 'react';

export const useFacebookPixel = () => {
  const track = useCallback((eventName: string, parameters = {}) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.fbq) {
      window.fbq('track', eventName, parameters);
    }
  }, []);

  const trackCustom = useCallback((eventName: string, parameters = {}) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.fbq) {
      window.fbq('trackCustom', eventName, parameters);
    }
  }, []);

  return { track, trackCustom };
};
```

#### Common Events Implementation

## Testing Infrastructure (Only When Requested)

### Important: Tests Are Created On-Demand Only
Tests are NOT created during the initial project setup. The testing infrastructure is installed and configured, but actual tests are only written when explicitly requested by the user.

### Test Folder Structure (Created Empty During Setup)
```
/test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Instructions for creating tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright.config.ts        # Pre-configured and ready
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/                       # Empty - tests go here when requested
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page-objects/              # Empty - page objects go here when requested
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/                  # Empty - custom fixtures go here when requested
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                     # Empty - helpers go here when requested
```

### Test README.md Content
The following README is created in the /test folder during setup:

```markdown
# Playwright Testing Guide

## When to Create Tests
Only create tests when explicitly requested. Common test scenarios:
- Contact form submissions
- Navigation flows
- Facebook Pixel events
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance benchmarks

## How to Request a Test
Ask Claude: "Create a test for [specific feature]"
Example: "Create a test for the contact form that verifies email sending and Facebook Pixel tracking"

## Test Commands
- `npm run test:ui` - Open UI mode with browser preview (recommended for development)
- `npm test` - Run all tests headless
- `npm run test:debug` - Debug mode with breakpoints
- `npm run test:headed` - Run tests with visible browser
- `npm run test:codegen` - Record a new test by interacting with the site

## Test Organization
Tests will be created in /test/e2e/ with descriptive names:
- contact-form.spec.ts
- navigation.spec.ts
- facebook-pixel.spec.ts
- mobile-responsive.spec.ts
```

### Pre-configured playwright.config.ts
This configuration is created during setup:

```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './test/e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,

    {
      name: 'Mobile Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'Mobile Safari',
      use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
    },
  ],
  
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    stdout: 'ignore',
    stderr: 'pipe',
  },
});
```

### Test Scripts Added to package.json
During setup, these scripts are added:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "playwright test",
    "test:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:debug": "playwright test --debug",
    "test:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "test:report": "playwright show-report",
    "test:codegen": "playwright codegen http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

### Example Test Creation Workflow

1. **User Request**: "Create a test for the contact form"

2. **Claude Creates Test File**: `/test/e2e/contact-form.spec.ts`
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Contact Form', () => {
  test('should submit form and track Facebook Pixel Lead event', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    
    // Fill out the form
    await page.fill('[name="name"]', 'Test User');
    await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
    await page.fill('[name="message"]', 'Test message');
    
    // Submit the form
    await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
    
    // Verify success message
    await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible();
    
    // Verify Facebook Pixel event (if applicable)
    // This would check that fbq('track', 'Lead') was called
  });
});
```

3. **Running the Test**: 
   - User: "Run the contact form test with UI mode"
   - Claude executes: `npm run test:ui`
   - Result: Browser preview opens showing test execution

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Zero Overhead**: No tests created until actually needed
2. **Visual Debugging**: UI mode provides browser preview for easy debugging
3. **Ready Infrastructure**: Everything configured, just ask to create tests
4. **Clear Documentation**: README explains when and how to test
5. **Multiple Browsers**: Tests can run on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile

### Common Test Scenarios to Request

- **Form Testing**: "Create a test for all form submissions"
- **Navigation**: "Create a test for the navigation menu on mobile"
- **Facebook Pixel**: "Create a test to verify Facebook Pixel events fire correctly"
- **Performance**: "Create a test to ensure page loads under 3 seconds"
- **Responsive**: "Create a test to verify mobile layout"
- **User Flows**: "Create a test for the complete user journey from landing to conversion"
